`write about your code`
You could start with something like "I made UI improvements with the colour of each route being drawn using a hsb so I have a good separation of colours.  These are a hash of the stopid mod 360 so the hue is spread around."

## Important Strutures
`write here about your stuctures` This is where you show us you understand what the code does and how it sorts information.  You could link to the code that does the Trie for example with [code for Tri add](/src/comp261/assig1/Trie.java#L18-25)

## Good example of data structure use
I am particularly proud of
`write something you did that is good`
